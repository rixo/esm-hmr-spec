# Snowgun

> Spawning Snowpack projects on-demand for testing purposes.

**Status:** work in progress, currently focused on testing Snowpack HMR behaviour.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rixo/snowgun.git
cd snowgun
yarn
```

## Usage

```bash
yarn test
```

## Development

Snowgun is powered by ~~poorly~~ lightly documented [zoar](https://github.com/rixo/zoar) test runner, and [zorax](https://github.com/rixo/zorax) extensions (themselves built upon the great [zora](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/zora) essentialist testing library).

Here are a few tips about the most useful commands you can use...

**NOTE** `zoar` is aliased as `test` in `package.json`, but all the following commands are really just running `zoar` itself... You could just as well use `yarn zoar` or `node_modules/.bin/zoar`.

### Watch mode

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

In watch mode, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will rerun the tests.

Also, further options can be passed / changed interactively, without the need to restart the test runner. The available options are essentially the same as the argument accepted by the cli (see bellow for a curated selection).

The interactive console accepts options in long (e.g. `--filter`) or shortcut (e.g. `-f`), with or without the leading `--` / `-`.

Adding `?` after the option name will display the current option value. Adding `!` will reset the option to `false` / empty.

Entering just `!!` (or pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>) will reset all options to their _initial_ value (that is, the value that have been passed to the cli command).

So you can do something like this (`$` is the term, `>` is zoar's interactive console):

```bash
$ zoar -w -f sanity
...
> f? # show the current filter
> f! # reset the filter
...
> ls # print matched files (switches to ls mode)
> f single # change the filter (and rerun ls)
> run #  run the tests (switches back to run mode)
...
> ib # debug the test in Node (short for --inspect-brk)
...
> ib! # stop debugging in Node
...
> e OPEN # open the browser while running test (allowing for in-browser debugging)
...
> e? # display current env variables that are passed to the test process
> e! # stop opening browser while running test
...
> !! # reset to initial options (`-f sanity`, in this example)
```

### Useful options

Help:

```bash
yarn test --help
```

Run test process with `--inspect-brk` (allow debugging Snowpack code):

```bash
yarn test --inspect-brk
```

Open Playwright browser while running tests (with slowmo and also cancelling tests timeout -- allow debugging the JS running in the browser, by adding `debugger` in the fixtures' JS):

```bash
yarn test --env OPEN
```

Display brower console output:

```bash
yarn test --env CONSOLE
```

Filter tests by file name:

```bash
yarn test --filter sanity
```

Show the files matched by your filter:

```bash
yarn test --ls
```

Filter tests by test name:

```bash
yarn test --grep serve
```

Print all the tests matched by the filters (instead of running them):

```bash
yarn test --print
```

Modifier options can all be mixed and matched:

```bash
yarn test --filter sanity --grep serve --ls
yarn test --filter sanity --grep serve --print
```
